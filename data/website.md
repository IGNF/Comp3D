**Comp3D** is an open-source micro-geodesy compensation software that enables computation on a limited spread network (few kilometers) using a global 3D least-squares bundle adjustment on several topometric observation types.
The computation is done in a local 3D system based on an oblique stereographic projection with a spherical Earth model.
